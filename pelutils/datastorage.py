class DataStorage:
    """ The DataStorage class is an augmentation of the dataclass that incluces save and load functionality.
    DataStorage classes must inherit from DataStorage and be annotated with `@dataclass`. Data will be saved
    to two files: A json files for json-serializable data and a pickle file for everything else. These files
    are by default named after the class, but it is possible to use a custom name in the save and load methods.
    The files are only created if necessary, so for instance if all data is json-serializable, no pickle file
    will be created.

    Data is in general preserved exactly as-is when saved data is loaded into memory with few exceptions.
    Nnotably, tuples are considered json-serializble, and so will be saved to the json file and will be
    loaded as lists.

    Usage example:
    ```py
    @dataclass
    class ResultData(DataStorage):
        shots: int
        goalscorers: list
        dists: np.ndarray

    rdata = ResultData(shots=1, goalscorers=["Max Fenger"], dists=np.ones(22)*10)
    rdata.save("max")
    # Now shots and goalscorers are saved in <pwd>/max/ResultData.json and dists in <pwd>/max/ResultData.pkl

    # Then to load
    rdata = ResultData.load("max")
    print(rdata.goalscorers)  # ["Max Fenger"]
    ``` """
